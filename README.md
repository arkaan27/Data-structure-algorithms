# Big O(n)

When writing algorithms, we must always consider 3 things.

1. Readability of Code - Depending on the team you are working with, you should consider the readability
of your code. Some teams can understand complex algorithms and some can't. Work around your team to build the knowledge
from bottom- up. 
2. Time complexity- As the size of input increases, the time taken for giving a solution is always a consideration. You want
to minimise the time taken for giving a solution. Usually it is through using more space or thinking of a better logic.
3. Space complexity - How much memory is consumed, when 




# Data Structures

Understanding different data structures is the key to write
optimised algorithms. 

## Arrays

Example: [1,2,3,4,5]


## Hash Maps

Example: {a:1, b:2, c: 3, d: 7}


## Strings

Example: "abc"

### Substrings


### Palindrome

Example: "racecar"

## Linked Lists



### Singly Linked List

class ListNode{

        

Example: 1 => 2 => 3 => 4 => 5 => None

1 = Head
5 = Tail

### Doubly Linked List

`class ListNode{
        value: any,
        prev: ListNode,
        next: ListNode
}
`

Example: None <= 1 <=> 2 <=> 3 <=> 4 <=> 5 => None

1 = Head
5 = Tail

### Multi Level Doubly Linked List
